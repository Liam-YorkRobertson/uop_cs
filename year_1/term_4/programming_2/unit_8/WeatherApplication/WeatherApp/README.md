How to run:

1.	Clone the repository from GitHub using the following link: https://github.com/Liam-YorkRobertson/uop_cs.git 
2.	Navigate to the WeatherApp directory: uop_cs/year_1/term_4/programming_2/unit_8/WeatherApplication/WeatherApp
3.	Ensure that Maven is installed on your system. You can verify this by running mvn -version in the terminal. If Maven is not installed, please refer to the official Maven installation guide.
4.	Run the project using Maven by executing the command: mvn javafx:run

Implementations:

This project allowed me to explore several new technologies and deepen my understanding of Java. Much of my knowledge of GUI development originated from Eck (2022), whose textbook provided a thorough overview of Swing and JavaFX. However, for this specific project, I primarily relied on resources from Material UI Dashboard (2021) for insights into Java GUI development.
A significant amount of my time was spent learning how to use NetBeans IDE and SceneBuilder. These tools helped me replicate the designs demonstrated in the video tutorials, and I believe I was able to successfully implement the key concepts. These resources made UI design considerably easier, with most adjustments made in SceneBuilder and only minor changes required in the actual FXML file.
CSS was used to style some components, a skill I had previously learned, but adjustments were needed to integrate it effectively with Java. Programming the weatherController was particularly challenging, and I sought guidance from various resources, including GeeksForGeeks, W3Schools, StackOverflow, GitHub Copilot, and several YouTube videos to implement some of my ideas.
Notably, I opted to use the OpenWeatherMap API (n.d.) for fetching weather data. I followed its documentation to properly make API calls, leveraging the API to display weather condition images rather than storing them locally (which I did for the dynamic background).
